# Firebase Realtime Database: Handling the Uncommon Database.ServerResponseError (-1)

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when interacting with the Firebase Realtime Database: `FirebaseError: Database.ServerResponseError` with status code -1. This error lacks detailed documentation and often stems from transient network or server problems. The included examples show how to identify and handle this error.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts a write operation (a `set()` operation in this example) to the database. Under specific conditions (like a temporary network interruption or server issue), it is likely to trigger the `Database.ServerResponseError` (-1).

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a robust solution. It uses error handling (`catch` block) to intercept this specific error. It adds retry logic with exponential backoff to handle transient network issues and to prevent immediate failure. The retry mechanism is optional and can be adjusted to fit your application's needs.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have a Firebase project set up and that you have the necessary Firebase JavaScript SDK installed.
2. Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` with your project's actual config.
3. Run the script using Node.js.  You might need to install necessary dependencies:  `npm install firebase`
