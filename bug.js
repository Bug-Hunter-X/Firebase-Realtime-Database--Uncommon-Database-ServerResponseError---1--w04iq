The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: Database.ServerResponseError` error with a status code of -1. This error is not well documented and can be tricky to debug. It typically happens during write operations, like `set()`, `update()`, or `push()`. The root cause can vary, including network issues, temporary server problems, or issues with security rules.
